2. No Internet Connection Needed
3. No Permissions Required
4. Share verse or verse reference
5. Copy verse or verse reference to the clipboard.

# Sources:

Bible verses come from: <https://github.com/brendancol/king-json-bible>
And the English-Afrikaans names come from <https://wordproject.org/bibles/af_2/index_en.htm#1>

# Notes:

* I do not own any of the content, content comes from above sources.
* This app was written for a friend, and does not contain any of my own religious views.
* The first run of this app will take awhile to load while the local database populates.
